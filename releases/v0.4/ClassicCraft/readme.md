# ClassicCraft
*A WoW Classic simulation tool*

### How to use :
- Download and extract the content of the .zip file anywhere on your computer
- Modify `sim.json` to setup the simulation
	- As of 0.3.1, you can use the [ClassicCraft Addon on Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccraft) to speed up the process (but at the moment some stats like Crit or Hit rating aren't supported by the addon, so you need to fill them by hand afterwards)
	- You can use the examples in the folder `sim.json examples` if needed
- Execute `ClassicCraft.exe`
	- A console should appear and the simulations start
	- Depending on the desired accuracy (`TargerErrorPct` or `NbSim`) and if `StatsWeights` is activated, the process might take some time
- A new .txt file with the logs of the simulation is created in the `Logs` folder, press any key in the console window to close it

### FAQ
- When will X class be implemented ?
	- Not a class order but here is a rough roadmap : Popular DPS Melee Specs -> Popular DPS Caster Specs -> GUI -> Alternative DPS Melee and Caster Specs -> Multiple Targets -> Bonus features (multiple players, tanking/healing sim, ...)
- Is X item implemented yet ?
	- Try it yourself and you'll see if it works! The program detects special effects by their item's name, so check for typos if it doesn't. A complete list of supported items will be written, one day.
- Is X set implemented yet ?
	- For now, sets providing stats boost have to be added manually in the `sim.json` file (either along with one of the items or as a Buff). Special set effects are detected by checking pieces names, so write them carefuly. A complete list of supported special sets will be written, one day.
