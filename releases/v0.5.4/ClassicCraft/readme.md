	- A window will appear, letting you set-up the simulation in the `Simulation setup` and `Player setup` tabs
		- You can select, create and save Simulation and Player profiles.
		- The `Player equipment` tab is under development, you'll have to edit your file `\Config\Player\*yourfile*.json` manually to change the equipped items (providing its name, stats, enchant and gems).
	- Click the `Let's go` button on the bottom-right when you're ready!
	- Depending on the desired accuracy (`TargerErrorPct` or `NbSim`) and if `StatsWeights` is activated, the process might take a while. You can follow the progress by looking at the bottom bar!
	- You'll be redirected automatically to a new `Results` tab at the end of the process, where the results will be displayed. A new .txt file with them is also saved in the `Logs` folder.

### FAQ
- When I try to run a simualtion there seems to be an error
	- Try searching for corrupted files in `\Config\Player\` and `\Config\Sim\` folders, and resetting them to the example files in the release. If you're still having issues please copy/paste (or screenshot) the error and open a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zwyk/ClassicCraft/issues)!
- Is X item's/set's special effect implemented yet ?
	- Try running a simulation with the item/set equipped (__its name properly written__) and activating "Full Fight Log" ("LogFight" in the json) to see if it procs or is being used! For sets, you if you want to test the X parts effect, you'll need to have X items with the set's name in it. If it seems to be not implemented, open a ticket.
- Is there a Wiki with all the information about the program (mechanics, proc-rates, etc.) ?
	- Not yet, but it would be great. Scrap the code for now, or ask me!
- When will X class/thing be implemented ?
	- Not a proper roadmap but here is a rough order of priority (purely personnal and indicative) : Popular Melee Specs > GUI > Popular Caster Specs > Alternative DPS Specs > Extra features (multiple players, healing sim, ...)
